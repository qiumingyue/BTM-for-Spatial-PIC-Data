# BTM-for-Spatial-PIC-Data
## Project description

The objective of this project is to build functions and algorithms for the semiparametric transformation model with spatial partly interval-censored data, which is  proposed in the Article ```Bayesian Transformation Model for Spatial Partly Interval-censored Data```. Several Julia functions have been created for using the model.
